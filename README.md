## Goals

- At all costs, "infrastructure as code" (I'm going with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/))
- Document and present what I learn in the process of building it
- A place for showcasing my work
- A place for writing learnings and musings

# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a blank project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
