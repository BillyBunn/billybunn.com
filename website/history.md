I'm a software developer based in Seattle, WA with a professional background in finance.

Previously, I was a financial statement auditor for an international
accounting firm. I worked face-to-face with clients in middle-market
companies to audit their financial statements and processes. I made a
career change to software when I realized coding was much more suited to
my passion for solving users problems and my interest in new technologies.
Read more about that below.

### Background

Right out of high school, I moved from my small town in Northern
California up to Seattle. There, I worked in online retail, copywriting,
and bookkeeping while earning my B.A. in Accounting from the <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/">University of Washington Bothell</a>.

After graduating, I landed a job that gave me experience working
face-to-face with clients and an inside-look at how large businesses are
operated—I was a financial statement auditor at an international
accounting firm and on the road to earning my CPA credential.

I enjoyed working on small teams to serve clients and their
users/customers, but I realized that my coding hobby was more suited for
my passions—building solutions to people's problems and constant learning.

### The Transition to Coding

In late 2018, I took a leap and left the finance world to study coding and
develop software full-time. I attended an intensive 20 week software
development bootcamp in Seattle called <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">Code Fellows</a>, where I studied and built full-stack applications 70+ hours a week. I specialized in a
modern JavaScript stack, but—more importantly—learned how to absorb
documentation quickly, meet rapid deadlines, and get working results out
the door.

After graduating from Code Fellows, I continued to code everyday.  I made several full-stack applications with modern tools and libraries.
I built things with React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and more. You can
see some of that work [here](../projects).

I also worked as a private tutor for Code Fellows. I taught students one-on-one in the basics of
programming and JavaScript fundamentals.
